Elon Musk has bought twitter
------

I figured I'd post here again since the original onus for setting this up was to flee twitter. I am not leaving twitter, but I do still like the idea of carving out my little corner of the internet outside of corporate control.[^1]

I do have a plain text file somewhere on my computer with several other posts I want to write about previous work I did in college and elsewhere, I’ll get to that someday. I have wanted to write my game of the year list somewhere and have also entertained writing a game of the year list for ever year going back to roughly when I started playing videogames. 

Also, y'all! There are some good tv shows I've watched, maybe I’ll write about the media I’ve enjoyed this year. I am following along with a seasonal release of an anime for the first time in several year, [Chainsaw Man][Chainsaw Man] and [Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury][Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury].

Speaking of anime here is another recommendation,

[Patlabor 2: The Movie][Patlabor 2: The Movie]

Patlabor 2: The Movie was directed by Mamoru Oshii right before he directed [Ghost in the Shell][Ghost in the Shell], one of the greatest animated films of all time. In Patlabor 2 Oshii is experimenting with the techniques and themes of GitS, there are cool forced perspective shots as well as a beautiful but unsettling sequence of a Tokyo under occupation by the Japanese Defense Force. Here is a [video about Patlabor 2] and if you are on the fence about watching it I think it’s worth checking out even with some of its spoilers.  

Thats all for now, I'll probably write that thing about my favorite media of the year soon. 

thx,
